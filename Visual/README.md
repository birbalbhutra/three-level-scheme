### About Project

Research Paper used is - **"Combine use of Steganography and Visual Cryptography for Secured Data hiding in Computer Forensics"**

In this project we have used the concept of steganography which is a means of hiding secret data in digital media.

Encryption - One Image file and Secret Message is inserted.

Decryption - We generate two encrypted image files after encryption and we use those two image files for decryption to receive the encrypted message.
